    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Place cream cheese and ranch dressing mix in a microwaveable, broiler-safe 9-inch square casserole dish. Microwave on HIGH until combined and 
          cream cheese is very soft, stirring halfway through, about 1 minute.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges are bubbly, 25 to 30 minutes. Increase oven temperature to broil; cook until cheese is lightly 
          golden brown in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and sprinkle with additional bacon and scallions. Serve immediately.</li>
